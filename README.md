# Hop

[![Build Status][1]][2]

The simplest Haskell program as a Cabal package.

This is meant to be a simple but complete Cabal package. It provides a library,
an executable, a test suite, and some benchmarks. None of them really do
anything.

The name comes from *H*askell n*op*.

## Setup

``` sh
sudo apt-get -y install haskell-platform haskell-platform-doc
make
```
